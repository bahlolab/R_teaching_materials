GO:1901609,"Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of vesicle transport along microtubule.",BP,negative regulation of vesicle transport along microtubule
GO:0047496,"The directed movement of a vesicle along a microtubule, mediated by motor proteins. This process begins with the attachment of a vesicle to a microtubule, and ends when the vesicle reaches its final destination.",BP,vesicle transport along microtubule
GO:0018107,The phosphorylation of peptidyl-threonine to form peptidyl-O-phospho-L-threonine.,BP,peptidyl-threonine phosphorylation
